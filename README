QUICK START:

Install SQL::Shell by unpacking the tarball and running the following
commands in the source directory:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
    Then delete the source directory tree since it's no longer needed.

The optional database unit tests have been optimized for SQLite.  If you want 
to run these, please install

    DBD::SQLite

and set the following environment variables as follows before running
"make test":

   UNIT_TEST_DSN="DBI:SQLite:dbname=test.db"
   UNIT_TEST_USER=anything
   UNIT_TEST_PASS=

The unit test script will create a file called t/data/test.db, and will 
remove it at the end of the testing.

Run 'perldoc SQL::Shell' to read the full documentation.


RECENT CHANGES


v1.16

Corrected the copyright notices throughout the code to properly match the 
COPYING file already distributed with the module.

Added new commands 'send' and 'recv' to give users better control of how 
their commands are interpreted when they don't match predefined patterns.

Simplified the functionality of the 'show tables' command to improve 
performance on platforms with large numbers of tables. (The old functionality 
is still present in the new 'show tablecounts' command.)

Added a new command 'show settings' to list some of the shell's internal 
parameters.  More of the settings will be added to this listing in the future.

Modified the DB tests to work best with SQLite, as it was nearly impossible 
to maintain compatibility with all DB platforms.


v1.15

Fixed several long-standing issues.  All of them were minor.
