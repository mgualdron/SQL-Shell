QUICK START:

Install SQL::Shell by unpacking the tarball and running the following
commands in the source directory:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
    Then delete the source directory tree since it's no longer needed.

To run the unit test against a database, define the following environment variables before running "make test":

   UNIT_TEST_DSN (a DBI DSN)
   UNIT_TEST_USER
   UNIT_TEST_PASS

The unit test script will trash any tables in this database (hence point at an empty database).

Run 'perldoc SQL::Shell' to read the full documentation.
